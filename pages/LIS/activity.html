                    What is a LAN party?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    A LAN party is a social gathering of video game enthusiasts who bring their own computers or game consoles to connect to a local area network (LAN) for the purpose of playing multiplayer games together. LAN parties typically involve participants setting up their computers in a common space, such as a conference room, a friend's house, or an event venue, and then connecting to each other over a wired or wireless network to play games.
                    <br>
                    LAN parties can be organized for a variety of reasons, such as to celebrate a game release, to compete in tournaments, or simply to socialize and have fun with like-minded gamers. They can range in size from a few friends getting together for an evening of gaming to large-scale events with hundreds or even thousands of participants.
